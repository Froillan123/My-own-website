            <h2>Coffee</h2>
            <p>Coffee enthusiasts all around the world are unlikely to consider the health benefits or hazards of their favorite morning beverage. Nonetheless, there is a long history of dispute surrounding this beverage. In 1991, the World Health Organization added coffee to its list of possible carcinogens. By 2016, the beverage had been exonerated, as a study revealed that it was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a lower risk of several malignancies among persons who drank coffee on a regular basis, once smoking history was properly accounted for.

        <h2><span>Coffee and Health</span></h2>
            <p>Coffee is a complex blend of almost a thousand ingredients. [1] The coffee you order in a coffee shop is probably not the same as the coffee you brew at home. The type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of ground, and how it is brewed are what characterize a cup. Individual responses to coffee or caffeine might also differ significantly. Caffeine at low to moderate amounts (50-300 mg) may boost alertness, energy, and concentration, however higher dosages may produce anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate.</p>

            <h2><span>Is coffee good for you? Health benefits, disadvantages, and more</span></h2>
            <p>People commonly associate coffee with its capacity to deliver an energy boost. However, according to certain studies, it may also provide some major health advantages. Some of these advantages may include a reduced risk of liver cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure.</p>
            <p>Experts estimate that over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed globally each day. Coffee use has been studied for its potential advantages in illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. Some, but not all, of these claims are supported by evidence.

                Coffee is rich in minerals such as riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), magnesium, potassium, and different phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts believe that these and other coffee constituents can help the human body in a variety of ways. This article examines the potential health advantages of coffee, the evidence supporting those benefits, and the hazards of coffee consumption.</p>
