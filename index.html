            <h2>Coffee</h2>
            <p>Coffee enthusiasts all around the world are unlikely to consider the health benefits or hazards of their favorite morning beverage. Nonetheless, there is a long history of dispute surrounding this beverage. In 1991, the World Health Organization added coffee to its list of possible carcinogens. By 2016, the beverage had been exonerated, as a study revealed that it was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a lower risk of several malignancies among persons who drank coffee on a regular basis, once smoking history was properly accounted for.

        <h2><span>Coffee and Health</span></h2>
            <p>Coffee is a complex blend of almost a thousand ingredients. [1] The coffee you order in a coffee shop is probably not the same as the coffee you brew at home. The type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of ground, and how it is brewed are what characterize a cup. Individual responses to coffee or caffeine might also differ significantly. Caffeine at low to moderate amounts (50-300 mg) may boost alertness, energy, and concentration, however higher dosages may produce anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate.

            <h2><span>Is coffee good for you? Health benefits, disadvantages, and more</span></h2>
            <p>People commonly associate coffee with its capacity to deliver an energy boost. However, according to certain studies, it may also provide some major health advantages. Some of these advantages may include a reduced risk of liver cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure.</p>
            <p>Experts estimate that over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed globally each day. Coffee use has been studied for its potential advantages in illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. Some, but not all, of these claims are supported by evidence.

                Coffee is rich in minerals such as riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), magnesium, potassium, and different phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts believe that these and other coffee constituents can help the human body in a variety of ways. This article examines the potential health advantages of coffee, the evidence supporting those benefits, and the hazards of coffee consumption.</p>

            <h2><span>Changing research findings</span></h2>
            <center><p>The wild changes in coffee's health status underscore a basic scientific difficulty. Our understanding of the world around us changes as we explore and learn, and research is a continual process. We question, investigate, and make judgments based on the best available information. These decisions might and should change as new information becomes available.
            In 1981, a prominent New York Times opinion piece declared unequivocally that our morning cup was leading us to an early grave. As they swore off coffee and faced the grey reality of their post-coffee life, the writers wrung their hands. Their fervent beliefs were fueled by a recent study in which experts conclusively connected even moderate coffee drinking to an increase in premature death.
            Three years later, several of the same scientists contradicted the paper, and the editors were likely back in their coffee cups - if they had ever moved away.

The initial study was well-done, with over 1,000 patients from almost a dozen hospitals and five prominent scientists participating. The findings were unambiguous, and the conclusions appeared to be justified. A subsequent study, however, failed to reproduce the authors' admittedly surprising findings: there was no link between consuming coffee and premature death.
What happened? One factor could have been the researchers' reliance on the p value, a popular metric of statistical significance. The value was created as a way to study data, but it is frequently regarded as a silver bullet for identifying noteworthy results.

However, there is no reliable, objective, or irrefutable method for identifying or quantifying the relevance of a result. We can draw fair conclusions with some degree of confidence, but that is about as good as it gets.
We must question conclusions that appear too good to be true, such as the idea that consuming a plant toxin will make us live longer, that only eating a fictional caveman diet will make us healthier, that acting as if the COVID-19 pandemic is over, despite daily evidence that it isn't, will make it go away, or that simply ignoring massive weather fluctuations will make global climate change disappear. A little common sense may go a long way.</p></center>
